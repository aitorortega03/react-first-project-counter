# Counter with Vite, React, and Bootstrap

This is a simple counter application developed using Vite for project setup, React for the user interface, and Bootstrap for basic styling. It's a quick starter project for learning and practicing the fundamentals of web development with these technologies.

## Requirements

Before getting started, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aitorortega03/react-first-project-counter.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd react-bootstrap-counter
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage
Once you've cloned the project and installed the dependencies, you can start the application with the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start the application in development mode. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:5173 to see the counter in action (it's the port where Vite execute the Dev Server).

## Features
- Increase the counter by clicking "Increment."
- Decrease the counter by clicking "Decrement" (disabled if the counter is 0).
- Reset the counter to 0 by clicking "Reset" (disabled if the counter is 0).
